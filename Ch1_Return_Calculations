## Overview and History of R
* **R** = dialect of the **S** language
    * S was developed by John Chambers @ Bell Labs
    * initiated in 1976 as internal tool, originally FORTRAN libraries
    * 1988 rewritten in C (version 3 of language)
    * 1998 version 4 (what we use today)
* **History of S**
    * Bell labs $\rightarrow$ insightful $\rightarrow$ Lucent $\rightarrow$ Alcatel-Lucent
    * in 1998, S won the Association for computing machineryâ€™s software system award
* **History of R**
    * 1991     created in New Zealand by Ross Ihaka & RobertGentleman
    * 1993     first announcement of R to public
    * 1995     Martin Machler convinces founders to use GNU General Public license to make R free
    * 1996     public mailing list created R-help and R-devel
    * 1997     R Core Group formed
    * 2000     R v1.0.0 released
* **R Features**
    * Syntax similar to S, semantics similar to S, runs on any platforms, frequent releasees
    * lean software, functionalities in modular packages, sophisticated graphics capabilities
    * useful for interactive work, powerful programming language
    * active user community and ***FREE*** (4 freedoms)
         * freedom to run the program
         * freedom to study how the program works and adapt it
         * freedom to redistribute copies
         * freedom to improve the program
* **R Drawbacks**
    * 40 year-old technology
    * little built-in support for dynamic/3D graphics
    * functionality based on consumer demand
    * objects generally stored in physical memory (limited by hardware)
* **Design of the R system**
    * 2 conceptual parts: base R from CRAN vs. everything else
    * functionality divided into different packages
         * **base R** contains core functionality and fundamental functions
         * other utility packages included in the base install: `util`, `stats`, `datasets`, ...
         * Recommended packages: `bootclass`, `KernSmooth`, etc
    * 5000+ packages available

## Coding Standards
* Always use text files/editor
* Indent code (4 space minimum)
* limit the width of code (80 columns)
* limit the length of individual functions
